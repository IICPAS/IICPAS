# Quiz Upload Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to upload quiz questions using Excel files in the admin dashboard.

## Excel Format Requirements

### Required Columns
Your Excel file must have the following columns (case-insensitive):

| Column Name | Description | Required | Example |
|-------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **question** | The question text | Yes | "What is the capital of France?" |
| **option1** | First option | Yes | "London" |
| **option2** | Second option | Yes | "Paris" |
| **option3** | Third option | Yes | "Berlin" |
| **option4** | Fourth option | Yes | "Madrid" |
| **answer** | Correct answer (must match one of the options exactly) | Yes | "Paris" |

### Accepted Column Names
The system accepts both lowercase and uppercase column names:
- `question` or `Question`
- `option1` or `Option1`
- `option2` or `Option2`
- `option3` or `Option3`
- `option4` or `Option4`
- `answer` or `Answer`

## Example Excel Content

| question | option1 | option2 | option3 | option4 | answer |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| What is 2 + 2? | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 4 |
| Which planet is closest to the Sun? | Venus | Earth | Mars | Mercury | Mercury |
| What is the largest ocean? | Atlantic | Indian | Arctic | Pacific | Pacific |

## Important Rules

### 1. Answer Validation

- Question text cannot be empty
- Answer cannot be empty

### 3. File Format
- Supports both `.xls` and `.xlsx` files
- First sheet will be used for parsing

### 4. Empty Options
- If you have fewer than 4 options, leave unused option columns empty
- Empty options will be automatically filtered out

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Answer must match one of the options"** - Check spelling and case sensitivity
2. **"At least 2 options required"** - Make sure you have at least 2 non-empty options
3. **"Question is required"** - Ensure question column is not empty
4. **"Failed to parse Excel file"** - Check file format and ensure it's not corrupted

### Tips:
- Use the template as a starting point
